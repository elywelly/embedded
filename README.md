# Embedded

So many memes, so many platforms and so little time. Embedded is a platform to consolidate your favourite posts from various social media platforms. Just embed them onto your embedded profile. The best way to share all your top hits with others or revisit them.

## Vision

Simplifying the way `users` share their favourite posts or revisit content that they enjoy across multiple platforms. Embedded consolidates (embeds) them into one spot, their embedded profile.

`Users` require an account to use the platform. Upon login, the `user` can add to their profile through pasting an embedded link to a post they would like to add to their profile. They can also look up `other users` by their username to view their profile. If they enjoy a post they see, they can click to embed the post onto their own profile.

**Potential future feature:**

-   Ability for users to vote on posts they like.
-   Ability for users to upload unique posts that they created.
-   Ability for users to search for posts by theme.

## User Stories/Flow

-   `Jon` is across multiple platforms and enjoys revisiting funny memes and videos he sees online. He enjoys sharing them with his friend, `Rose`, but often forgets where he saw it from (Was it Facebook? Or was it Instagram?). Embedded is the perfect platform to consolidate all his favourite posts and share them with others of similar interests.

-   `Rose` is across multiple platforms and enjoys short videos and life hack tips she sees online, she uses Embedded to consolidate/revisit them. She also enjoys the occassional memes, which her friend, `Jon` sometimes shares with her.
